# 📋 Request for Proposals

Welcome to the GrantShares Request for Proposals (RFP) page. This section maintains a list of all active RFPs where the DAO is seeking specific solutions or implementations from the community.

## 📚 About RFPs

Request for Proposals (RFPs) are formal documents that outline specific needs or challenges the GrantShares DAO wishes to address. Each RFP includes detailed requirements, timeline, and budget allocation. While this page provides an overview of active RFPs, the complete documentation for each RFP is maintained in separate external pages/repositories to ensure proper ownership and proper documentation.

## ✅ Guidelines for Proposals

- Proposals should be submitted within the specified timeframe of each RFP
- All submissions should follow the format and requirements detailed in the specific RFP document
- Proposals must address all requirements outlined in the RFP
- Proposals should only be endorsed after the submission period is past due
