## Description

🌱 [GrantShares DAO](https://grantshares.io) is expanding! **We plan to add 5 new members to our DAO**, and we're actively inviting dedicated individuals and entities passionate about the Neo ecosystem to join us. As a GrantShares DAO member, you'll directly contribute to funding meaningful initiatives, shaping ecosystem growth, and promoting decentralized governance.

## Why Expand?

- 🔍 **Better Due Diligence:** More members mean stronger oversight, deeper analysis, and higher-quality decision-making on incoming project proposals.
- 🌟 **Community Growth:** Committed DAO members attract grassroots and innovative proposals, increasing our ecosystem's vibrancy and effectiveness.
- ⚡ **Empowering Governance:** Expanding our membership empowers passionate individuals who want to actively participate in DAO governance, decentralizing authority further and distributing responsibilities effectively.

## Who Should Apply?

- Active contributors in the Neo community, including developers, researchers, community leaders, and Web3 enthusiasts.
- Organizations or individuals experienced in blockchain governance, project management, or ecosystem growth.
- Those aligned with our core values: transparency, collaboration, and decentralization.

:::tip
*While we expect most applicants to be individuals or entities already actively contributing to the Neo ecosystem, we are also open to candidates from outside Neo who bring valuable experience from other DAOs, Layer 1s, Layer 2s, or broader Web3 ecosystems.*

## How to Apply?

Anyone can create a proposal called "Add Member" via the GrantShares dApp, through the Web interface.

🚨 **Pay attention to the following when creating your proposal:**

- Use your own words. Avoid blah blah blah from LLMs.
- In the title, include the RFP ID (**GS-001**) and the name/nickname of the applicant. For example: **GS-001: AxLabs**
- Highlight your contributions to the Neo ecosystem (or relevant experience elsewhere, e.g., in other DAOs or Web3 ecosystems).
- Mention why you or the proposed entity would add significant value to GrantShares.
- Add relevant governance, funding, or community-building experience.
- Include a link to your website, social media, or any other relevant links. Reputation is really important to us.

:::danger[Important]
Please, **do not** put the proposal on-chain BEFORE the RFP's [Submissions by](#general-info) deadline date. You can put it on-chain after the deadline -- allowing all applicants to have the same amount of time to submit their proposals.
